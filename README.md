As a digital badging pioneer, I advocate for badge earners to display their achievements proudly via social media, email footers and more.  However, I am curious on how these badges would be displayed in a responsive website portfolio as I think it would get more "traffic" for the recipients showcasing their work for future employers.

This project is a simple 3 page site, with an index/home page, a portfolio page showcasing how digital badges can be displayed in a responsive card format and a contact me page. It has been updated on 4/25 to include additional projects from my Bootcamp experience and some formatting changes. 

 I spent a bulk of the time experimenting with digital badge icons from my personal badge backpack. From the backpack (www.badgr.io) I can obtain dynamic, interactive content which will validate/ verify that I am the badge earner. Each badge icon is "baked" with metadata that points back to the evidence, date, learner and criterion for earning the badge.  The evidence can be a representation of the work done by the earner and the issuance of the badge demostrates the learner has met minimum rrequirements as set by the issuer.

Aside:  Quality digital badges are popular with learning communities as they represent competencies, skills and knowledge at a particular point in time.  Earning a badge is set by the badge issuer and issuers can design eye-catching emblems to represent their badges.  When the badge is issued using the Open Badges standard https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/digital-badges the meta-data is "baked" into the badge image and can be verified by any entity. Relevant to this project is the testing of an Badge API in progress by IMS Global for further interactivity.


Next steps for this project would include a deeper understanding of how to use the native API from Badgr via JavaScript and to convert this site into a React-type app.
